Specifications

The manager of the hostel enters in the hackers' names (one hacker per line) in the text box on the left, and then enters the date range for each respective hacker's stay on a new line in the text box on the right.
Each stay is in the format YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD.
The hacker name typed on the ith line of the left text box corresponds to the duration on the ith line of the right text box, so the total number of lines in the text boxes will always be equal.
During their stay, each hacker gets three meals per day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. After typing the names of the hackers and valid stay durations, the application generates a meals schedule on clicking the button in the following format:
Breakfast for name on date.
Lunch for name on date.
Dinner for name on date.
If there are multiple hackers, then the results must be ordered first by date and then by meal.
If the user enters an invalid stay duration, the application renders menus for the hackers with valid dates and an error message for hackers with invalid dates.
An error message for a hacker must read: Error! No menu generated for insert_hacker_name
Component flow diagram of the application is as follows:

BOOKING -> APP <- MEALS and ERROR -> APP
